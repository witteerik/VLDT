# VLDT - Video-Based Lexical Decision Task

This repository is contains an application for running video-based lexical decision tasks (VLDT). VLDT uses functionality from the library VLDT_lib, also developed in this repository.

In addition, this repository contains an application for rating videos, Video Rating Task (VRT). The VRT also uses functionality from the VLDT_lib library.

The repo also contains releases of both applications.

Additionally, we have begun to work on a third application, the Video-Based Learning Task (VLT). The VLT is not yet finished.

All applications use the LibVLCSharp and LibVLCSharp.WinForms libraries and their corresponding dependencies.
